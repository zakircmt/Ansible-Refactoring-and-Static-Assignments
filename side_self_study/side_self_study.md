# Ansible Artifact Re-Use

## Introduction

__Ansible__ is an open-source automation tool that simplifies various IT processes such as configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. One of the key features of Ansible is the ability to reuse artifacts, which enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures consistency across different playbooks and roles.

This documentation provides a detailed guide on how to effectively reuse artifacts in Ansible, based on the principles and practices outlined in the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse.html).


## Concepts

### 1. Roles

__Roles__ are a collection of tasks, variables, files, templates, and modules that can be reused across different playbooks. They help organize playbooks by encapsulating the necessary components for a particular functionality.

Structure of a Role:
```css
roles/
└── example_role/
    ├── tasks/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files/
    ├── templates/
    ├── vars/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── defaults/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta/
    │   └── main.yml
    └── tests/
        ├── inventory
        └── test.yml
```

### 2. Includes and Imports

Includes and imports are mechanisms to incorporate external content into a playbook. They help split complex playbooks into manageable pieces, enhancing readability and maintainability.

- __Include vs. Import:__

  - __Include:__ Dynamically includes tasks, roles, or other playbooks during the execution of a playbook.
  - __Import:__ Statically includes tasks, roles, or other playbooks at the time the playbook is parsed.

### 3. Variables

Variables in Ansible allow for dynamic content and flexible playbooks. They can be defined in various places such as inventory files, playbooks, roles, or external variable files.

### 4. Templates

Templates in Ansible use the Jinja2 templating engine to generate files dynamically based on variables and other data. Templates can be reused across different roles and playbooks.

### 5. Dynamic Includes

Dynamic includes enable the inclusion of content based on specific conditions during runtime. This allows for more flexible and dynamic playbooks.

## Implementing Reuse in Ansible

### Using Roles

1. Creating a Role:
To create a role, use the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init example_role
```

2. Using a Role in a Playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - example_role
```

### Using Includes and Imports

1. Including a Task File:

```yaml
- include_tasks: tasks/example_tasks.yml
```

2. Importing a Task File:

```yaml
- import_tasks: tasks/example_tasks.yml
```

3. Including a Role Dynamically:

```yaml
- include_role:
    name: example_role
```

### Using Variables

1. Defining Variables in a Playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
```

2. Using External Variable Files:

```yaml
- hosts: webservers
  vars_files:
    - vars/external_vars.yml
```

### Using Templates

1. Creating a Template:
Create a Jinja2 template file, for example templates/example_template.j2:

```jinja2
server {
    listen {{ http_port }};
    server_name {{ server_name }};
}
```

2. Using a Template in a Playbook:

```yaml
- name: Apply web server configuration
  template:
    src: templates/example_template.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/example
```

### Using Dynamic Includes

1. Conditionally Including a Task:

```yaml
- include_tasks: tasks/example_tasks.yml
  when: condition == "true"
```

## Best Practices

1. Modularize Playbooks: Break down complex playbooks into smaller, reusable components using roles, includes, and imports.

2. Use Variables Efficiently: Define variables at appropriate levels (playbooks, roles, external files) to enhance reusability and maintainability.

3. Template Standardization: Create standard templates that can be reused across multiple roles and playbooks.

4. Document Reusable Components: Ensure that all reusable components are well-documented to facilitate understanding and usage by other team members.


## Conclusion

Reusing artifacts in Ansible is a powerful way to enhance automation efficiency and maintainability. By leveraging roles, includes, imports, variables, templates, and dynamic includes, you can create modular, scalable, and reusable playbooks. Following the best practices outlined in this guide will help you get the most out of Ansible's capabilities for artifact reuse.
